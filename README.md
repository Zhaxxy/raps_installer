# raps_installer
Alternative to PSN Patch to install rap files on your CFW ps3 (I don't think it works on HEN).

# Requirments
Make sure you have at least one activated user on your PS3, if you must you can use [Apollo Save Tool (PS3)](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps3) to offline activate.<br>
Probably won't work on HEN.

# How to use?
Put your .rap files in your FAT32 formated USB in the `exdata` folder, plug it into your PS3 and make sure its detected. Or put your .rap files in `/dev_hdd0/exdata` folder.<br>Then just open the app and let it install them automatically.
